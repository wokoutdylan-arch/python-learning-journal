About Me  Hi, I'm Dylan, a student interested in data science and artificial intelligence. I enjoy learning how code can be used to solve real-world problems and build intelligent systems. I'm especially interested in how Python is used in AI, machine learning, and data analysis.

Goals for This Course: In this course, I hope to: Build a strong foundation in Python programming. Understand how to write clean and efficient code. Learn how Python is used in AI and data science. Gain confidence solving coding problems on my own

My First Python Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
